Dai Xi and the others involved with the creation were scholar-officials at the imperial court or its offices in the provinces.</text>

               <text>Dai Xi was commissioned by a young scholar to paint the landscape of Longqiu on Mount Yandang in eastern Zhejiang Province, a place renowned for its majestic waterfalls. The mountain was remote and nearly inaccessible, but the young scholar ventured to the distant site to admire the beautifully bizarre natural rock formations that complemented the spectacular dual falls cascading into the mountain's Dragon Pool. Dai Xi fittingly inscribed the beginning of the painting in ancient seal script, as if the title itself was carved on the very rock of the mountain. He built up layers of muted gray using an old, worn brush, gradually texturing the landscape to an extraordinary rich, silvery appearance. Dai Xi empathetically depicted his patron, the young scholar, seated alone in the poolside pavilion, serenely contemplating the clouds of fine mist rising from the roiling froth of the powerful falls.</text>

The scroll is bound with a woven silk tape with a flower and wave pattern in white and brown. The painting and calligraphies are written on separate sheets of a same smooth white paper marked with fine bamboo screen lines. The title, painting, and colophons are separated by two kinds of silk: a thin, plain light-blue fabric and a silk of natural color with a subtle pattern of clouds and dragons.</text>

               <text>The landscape depicts the site of Longqiu on Mount Yandang in eastern Zhejiang Province. Two waterfalls and their spray-filled, misty, roiling pool are surrounded by steep cliffs, pines, and natural rocks of eccentric shape and form. Opposite the falls are two buildings: a viewing pavilion in which a scholar sits at a table in solitary contemplation and a nearby open platform with a low roof. In attendance, two serving boys stand and gesture towards the falls from a flat rocky ledge. The site is described as "Remote and nearly inaccessible, the mountain is famed for its spectacular waterfalls at Longqiu (Dragon Pool). Situated one above the other are two falls, the Lesser and the Greater Longqiu. The greater falls are almost 30 meters high and drop directly into the pool below without touching the rock walls. The carved Song and Yuan dynasty inscriptions in the surrounding stone cliffs praise the site: 'Premiere Waterfall under Heaven,' 'Flying from Clouds,' and 'Mist of White Jade.'" 
                   References to remote and nearly inaccessible sites of natural beauty were hallmarks of Chinese literati expression from as late as the Six Dynasties period (220–589 C.E.) to contemporary times. During the Northern Song Dynasty, the calligrapher, painter, and poet Su Shi (1037–1101) wrote the prose-poem Ode to the Red Cliff which was filled with such expressive imagery that it became a traditional literati theme in painting. The waterfalls at Longqiu had a similar, albeit more modest, history of literary and aesthetic appreciation. The rock cliffs surrounding the falls were carved with poetic phrases in large characters that extolled the beauty and character of the site and its natural wonders. For the literati, a visit to Mount Yentang and the falls of Dragon Pool was an expression of their free and unencumbered spirits. </text>

               <text>To commemorate his trip to Lung-chi'iu, the scholar-official Wu Chung-chün (19th century) asked Tai Hsi to do the painting. At the time, the artist was a metropolitan examiner posted at the capital, one of the numerous official positions he held during his lifetime, but because Tai Hsi was renowned for his literati painting style, he was often sought out for commissions. [...] Between 1847 and 1849, Wu Chung-chün circulated the painting among his friends and superiors, requesting their calligraphy and poetry on the theme of the waterfalls at Lung-chi'iu. [...] The scroll serves as a superb example of the traditional literati practice in which an intimate group of scholars share in the creation and enjoyment of a work of art.</text>
